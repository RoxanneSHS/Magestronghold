@0    = ~I am working with one of the the more advanced students. He shows promise but is somewhat willful.~
@1    = ~Are you Melicamp's Tutor?~
@2    = ~Why, yes, I am indeed. How is his work going?~
@3    = ~I am afraid that he attempted a rather dangerous piece of magic, and has turned himself into a chicken. He has asked if you could please summon his old tutor Thalantyr, as Melicamp believes that only Thalantyr can lift the curse he is under.~
@4    = ~Yes, I have spoken to this Thalantyr before, when I first received Melicamp. I will send for him magically. Tell Melicamp he will be here presently.~
@5    = ~Thank you.~
@6    = ~You are welcome. I always feared Melicamp would toy with magics he could not control.~
