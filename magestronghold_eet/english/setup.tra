  Before the Time of Troubles, a powerful Thayan Red Wizard spent many years specializing and studying the art of Necromancy. Finally he made his bid for power within Thay and many wizards fell before his skill. However, as he neared his goal of domination of Thay, he was challenged by a powerful illusionist. They battled for nearly a hour. The illusionist wove many deceiving spells about himself. The necromancer had no knowledge of illusion, and so could not pierce them. He was forced to concede. As he left he cursed necromancy and vowed never to use it again. The final spell he cast was to create this amulet that destroyed necromantic magic - his final revenge on that spell school.

@93   = ~Pain's Shard +6
  This blade sparkles with magical energy as you draw it through the air. It seems to almost cut through the Planes themselves, leaving a blackness in its wake. This blade once adorned the Lady of Pain, the powerful ruler of Sigil, but was given to you by her for your great service. It protects from many things, including cold and instant death, as well as granting magic resistance and regeneration. When it strikes a target, there is a good chance that the target will be wracked with incredible pain. The blade also anchors the wielder to their plane of existence, making them immune to Maze and Imprisonment spells.
  So sharp is the blade that it cuts through reality itself. With each hit there is a small chance that the target will be thrown into another plane of existence. The sharpness of the blade also allows the wielder to cut through any magic that might hinder movement. Finally, the blade contains some of the power of the Lady. The wielder may access this power, allowing them to use the blade to cut through space and teleport to their desired location at will. It also allows them to cast the Banishment spell once a day, that flings one target into oblivion.  The blade cuts through magic as well and so with each hit the target may lose magic resistance or have physical spell protections removed.

  Most Staff of the Magi share powers in common. The more powerful staves, like the one famously owned by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun are rare, and the property of powerful Archwizards. This staff however outdoes them all. Its twisted black surface seems to shine with no light, and yet at the same time all the colors of the rainbow. It is not composed of  any material you can name, but feels as if it is woven of solid mists. This staff is believed to have been created by the ArchSorcerer Melanthium, the most powerful being to have ever existed and notorious enemy of the Lady of Pain. He carried the staff merely because he felt that it was part of the image, so he only enchanted it with his lesser magics. Like the sorcerer himself, this staff is incredibly powerful. It increases the user's ability to cast spells, protects the user from lesser weapons and spells cast at the user, and allows the casting of powerful spells with a wave of the staff.

A resourceful Archmage in Sigil collected some of the sands, imprisoning them inside this hourglass. The sand in this hourglass appears to continually flow, no matter how much the hourglass is tilted or shaken.

Objects may pass freely through the portal and are completely irretrievable, no doubt ending up floating in another plane of existence. Attacks made against the holder are severely hindered by the magical gate, and all missiles hitting the shield are absorbed into the rift. The shield however is strangely unnerving to anyone looking at its face, as an observer gets the distinct impression that something beyond the rift is staring back.

It is known by the wisest sages that certain themes run throughout the history of all realities, and that they are engraved in the very substance of creation. One of the best know themes is the noble prince rescuing the beautiful princess from the wicked witch. In this case however something went horribly wrong. The prince had battled his way through hordes of undead and through the mandatory Field of Thorns. He faced the witch in single combat, slaying the foul creature with a stroke of this sword. He climbed the tower and entered the princess' chamber. In a fit of passion, they ran towards each other their arms outstretched... The prince tripped, knocking the princess through the open window onto the mangled thorns below. His sword came loose as he fell, skewering him through the chest and killing him instantly. The normal theme of things had been broken, and the power of the story shattered. Some of it passing into this blade, causing it to become a powerful weapon.

However, the dispute arises from one of their creation components... the power of a mage. Unfortunately, a mage has to be killed in the creation of these items and so, as you might imagine, murders and assassinations were carried out right and left, until the magical community in general banned the construction of these stones, and destroyed all the stones they could find. Anyone found with this stone by a magical organization is likely to be heavily penalized. The stone's power deserves its reputation however, making its users magical abilities much stronger.

  A garment forged and worn by the Archlich Vecna, a powerful Lich who managed to achieve demi-godhood on one of the outer planes. This cloak easily displays Vecna's powerful magical ability. The cloak is woven from material from the demiplane of shadows. It is totally black, and seems some how alive. The cloak grants the user powerful protections, and is reputed to be able to call shadows to aid the caster.

@174  = ~Eye Of Vecna:
  
  Many tales are told of the Archlich Vecna. 
  It is said that Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its kingdom. 
  And so Vecna died, yet lived on.
  Abandoned by death, Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime world called Oerth. Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of great horror and suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even the Powers of Oerth feared to cross him, for fearing of drawing his eye.
  Yet, while Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he failed to see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his lieutenant, Kas. 
  As was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the Archlich had fashioned a terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice. 
  The sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, month upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' discipline was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Dessicated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle. 
  During the battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had dismembered his former master, scattering his remains so that no one may draw them together again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the Eye of Vecna. It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the eye will come to them, seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.
  The Eye of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. It is said to have been behind the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-the-Sea, which led to the three-cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai and left the oceanic world barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, it possessed the gentle father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead his suffering people from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... had not the eye drove Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping in his crib. All these kingdoms, all these futures, the Eye of Vecna laid waste.
  The Eye's powers are said to shift with each new owner, but one thing is certain: no good ever comes from whoever has the misfortune to possess it. It is destined to betray its wearer at a critical moment, failing him when he needs its power the most. 
  Effects:
  You can gouge out your normal eye and replace it with the eye of vecna (ouch). The effects will be permanent, and can never be reversed unless a replacement eye is found.

@184  = ~Robes of Chaos:
  These robes are first believed to have appeared in the planes over a century ago. They came from the Plane of Pandemonium, and were first in possession of the mad wizard mayor of the town of Bedlam. However, it is not from this plane that robes gather their power. Sages believe that the robes are woven from the plane of Limbo itself, and that the plane, through these robes, is attempting to spread chaos through the multiverse. This theory is supported by the sheer immensity of power in these robes. Although records are hard to come by, it appears that the robes' abilities vary for each person wearing them, but that these powers will always maximize the person's ability to make chaos. The robes are themselves totally chaotic, varying in style, color, shape and transparency as you look at them. Wearing the robes is ill-advised to any mage, as they can simply vanish at any time, turn into a pit fiend, or catapult the wearer in a plane of eternal fire. The robes also surround the wearer with an aura of wild magic, meaning their spells sometimes become unreliable. Better known in planar magical circles as the Robes of "Oh my God, what's happening to me?!", these robes are certainly a magical curiosity and their immense power can make a wizard rival the Gods Themselves, or do distinctly unpleasant things to their spleen.

  When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.
  
  This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spat back out of the portal. 
  (1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw vs death at +4, he will get spat out of the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 10d3 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles. 
  (2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts. ~

  Ajundurar's Ice Shard, a extremely useful spell often employed by powerful mages due to its comparatively short casting time. When the mage completes the incantation his hand bursts briefly into cold blue light and then a magical shard of freezing ice flies toward the target, inflicting cold damage upon them.

  This spell alters the makeup of the target creature's body. The molecules the creature is composed of begin to deform and slide over each other. The bonds between the target's atoms is weakened - in other words, they melt into a sticky puddle of slime on the floor.
  However, the target is not killed. Even in this gelatinous state they still have some control, although due to the fact that they are a puddle of slime, their ability to attack is greatly decreased.~

  Azuth, the lord of spells was once a powerful mortal Archmage until he ascended unto godhood. Shortly before he became a god, it is believed he forged this spell. It is perhaps his crowning achievement, even more so than immortality. However, soon after his ascension, this spell was destroyed, or apparently destroyed, by Mystra, for its power was to be feared, even by the Gods. This spell takes a mage a great deal of time of cast. However, when it is finally unleashed, nothing can withstand it. For a single instant it surrounds the target with total nothingness. This nothingness drains magic from the target, severely weakening them. It is perhaps the only way a mage can battle a God, for only a spell such as this can make a God vulnerable to a mage's magic.
  Effects:
  This spell wipes away magical resistances. When cast, the targets resistance to fire/ice/cold/magical damage will be set to -25%. Magic resistance will be set to 0. All physical and magical protections surrounding the caster will also be removed.~

  This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around him such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest.  He can, however, cast defensive spells on himself and fellow party members.  And if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~

  This spell creates a whirling mass of uncontrolled magic energy that crackles over the area of effect determined by the caster. The chaotic magical energy releases bursts of power that strikes everybody  in the area of effect while they remain in the cloud of magic. After a while the magic will dissipate away and the spell will end, however so chaotic is the spell that any spell caster within it will find that their spells stand a good chance of going haywire.
  Effects:
  Each round everyone in the area of effect takes 1d8+2 of electrical damage. And their is a 10% chance that any spell caster within the cloud will find their spells failing or becoming unpredictable.   ~

  (Evocation)
  Level: 9
  Range: 30ft 
  Duration: Permanent 
  Casting Time: 8 

  This is an amazing find and, for the adventuring mage, one of extreme use. The Wave of Obliteration spell was last seen being used around 100 years ago. Two nobles of Tethyr were fighting over their father's castle, as his will had left its ownership in debate. As so often is the case in contentious circumstances, the two nobles were both powerful Archmages, both having been tutored by their father in the art. This spell was apparently a family heirloom, and a source of great jealousy from other magical households. Needless to say, the two nobles decided that the only answer was for a duel. The results were unpleasant to say the least. Afterwards, it was deduced from the rubble that both magi had released this spell simultaneously. The effects indeed showed the power of this spell. One half of the castle was discovered several years later in a pond several miles away, although the servants were never found... The mages were both buried in very small coffins. 
  When the mage completes the incantation of this spell, he raises his hands and pushes his palms away from himself. From his hands a wall of pure, uncontrolled magical energy bursts. The magic explodes forth, taking everything in its path with it. Any creature caught within this energy wave will take massive damage from the energies involved, and must make a Save vs Spells or be literally obliterated by the sheer power of this spell.
  Effects:
  All creatures in the path of the spell will take 10D5+20 points of magical damage with no save. They must then make a Save vs Spells at -2 or be vaporised by the spell.~

  This immensely powerful spell is shrouded in mystery (probably because only 4 copies of it have ever been discovered). Its abilities are truly impressive making it possibly the most powerful protective spell available to the mage however no one knows where the spell originated from, although some sages believe it was created in the days of Myth Drannor. When the final word of the spell is spoken a globe of twisting magical energies springs up around the caster. The magical globe absorbs all energy that strikes it dissipating it into nothingness. The energy that can be absorbed can be either physical or magical in origin and is completely nullified by the sphere. The intensity of energy that the sphere can absorb relies solely on the ability of the mage who cast the spell and as the mage increases in power so does the spell. 
  At 16th level the spell protects from 1st to 3rd level spells and protects from non magical weapons.    
  At 17th level the sphere protects from 1st to 4th level spells and still protects from normal weapons but grants 25% resistance to all physical attacks.
  At 18th level the sphere protects from 1st to 5th level spells and grants immunity to normal and +1 weapons
  At 19th level the sphere protects from 1st to 6th level spells, gives immunity to normal and +1 weapons and gives 25% resistance to all physical attacks.
  At 20th level the sphere protects from 1st to 7th level spells and gives immunity to normal, +1 and +2 weapons.

  Many a powerful mage has looked down their noses at this spell when they were but magelings, only to stare in terror as it flew towards them later in life. At very low levels, this spell is, quite frankly, pathetic. However, as the mage advances, so the power of the spell increases. The spell creates a magical arrow of solidified power that flies from the casters hand to strike his selected target.
  Abilities:
  At levels 1-6 the arrow does 1D8 piercing damage with no save, and 2 magic damage on a failed Save vs Spells.
  At levels 7-12 the arrow does 2D6 of piercing damage and 2 fire/cold/elec damage with no saving throw. 
  At levels 13-18 the arrow does 3D8 + 2 magic damage, with a Save vs Spells for half. The target must also Save vs Death at -2 or be stunned for 2 rounds. The spells casting time is decreased by 1.
  At levels 19 and above the arrow becomes a shining flash of magic. It inflicts 5D8 points of magical damage save versus spell for half. The target must also make a Save vs Death at +2 or be killed. If they survive this, they are automatically stunned for 3 rounds.~

  Karsus was perhaps the most powerful of Archmages to come to power in ancient Netheril, and one of the most foolish, for he attempted to seize Godhood through his magic, and failed, being punished with an eternity of torment.

  When cast, the target is surrounded by an aura of magical crimson flames that literally burn the life of the target away. The flames last for 4 rounds, and each round the target must make a Save vs Death or be instantly killed. Even if the target resists the death magic, they are overcome with fear at being surrounded with the flames, and will run in fear until the flames extinguish. While a target is surrounded by the flames, their regeneration (if any) will cease, and they will be immune to all healing magics.~

  Killimer was your average adventuring mage. He was not particularly powerful, and spent his life in adventuring bands, battling the undead and any manner of evil foe you care to name. After four years with the same band of adventurers, he had become close to his companions in arms, and they to him. One day, the mage and his companions were beset by a group of powerful spellcasters, who had gained control of a local town and were dominating all the trade routes. Killimer's companions were helpless against the combined attack of so many magic-users. Two were destroyed by magical fire, and a third was turned into a small amphibian. Killimer, out of spells, called out a desperate prayer to Mystra, Goddess of Magic, for aid. The Lady, hearing his call, granted him this spell, and its words blazed across his mind like fire. As he incanted it the magic in the area began to wax and wane. The opposing magi found it nigh impossible to weave their spells, giving Killimer's companions the opportunity they needed to hack the spellcasters to pieces.
  Effects: 
  For the duration of the spell, all magic is slowed and distorted, and all spellcasting speeds are increased by 5 for enemy mages. Any enemy mages can make a Save vs Spells to avoid this effect, but they do so at -3.~

  With this spell the mage brings into being shimmering blades of magical force. The blades whirl around and when they strike a enemy explode in a small burst of magic. The knives can be controlled individually by the mage, and will remain for 1 hour before evaporating. Once they strike an opponent, they vanish forever.
  Effects:
  Each knife deals 5-10 magical damage. They act as +3 weapons, and stun the target for a short period if a Save vs Spells is failed at +2.
  The mage receives one knife for every five levels up to a maximum of 8 at 37th level. The knives are not harmed by physical or magical attacks but may be destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell.~

  This is the final spell of the arch lich Nagath. He spent many hundreds of years journeying the multiverse, on his final trip it is believed that he crossed paths with an Overgod (much like lord Ao) on the astral plane, needless to say the arch lich could not have won but as the god banished him to a plane of eternal fire the archlich screamed forth this terrible spell. The god was unharmed but a shock wave of tectonic violence ran through the astral plane killing many of its inhabitants. When invoked this spell conjurers material from upward of 10 different planes spewing forth a maelstrom of incredible violence. The main power of this spell lies in that it draws its energy from its targets and the more beings the greater the power of the spell and the greater its area of effect. For each being the area of effect 2d10 of damage is done with no save and 1d10 damage is done although this can be avoided with a save vs spells at -2. So fantastic is the is the sheer power of the spell that all in side the area of effect (if they survive) will be confused for the next 5 rounds. ~

  The mage Degrodel was one of the more unpleasant characters you met on your journeys in Baldur's Gate. He apparently was obsessed with the items of Balduran the great explorer. He believed that Dradeel Balduran's personal mage had hidden parts of the secret of a great spell in each of Balduran's items. Unfortunately you killed him before he could complete his research. This spell was one his favorites allowing him to summon 1-3  helmed horror to his service. The horrors will serve the caster without question for 2 hours and then vanish. ~

  A terrible spell to call upon indeed, this spell is considered so horrible that many magical societies have out lawed it (the research into this spell is believed to be one reason the red wizards of Thay split from the haluraans). When completed the soul of the target is surrounded by a cage of crackling energy that slowly shrinks pulling the soul of the victim into another plane where it is destroyed ( perhaps an anti-matter plane, or the negative energy plane). The death is exceeding horrible as the soul is literally torn free from the body, destroying both body and soul in the process. The victim is allowed a save vs death to avoid having their soul destroyed. Even if they save versus the spell they still take 2D10 damage and are nauseated for a short time.~

  Normally to conjure monsters or undead on a permanent basis requires much preparation and many rituals, this spell however being as powerful as it is allows the mage to summon forth a minion permanently in one easy spell. The spell allows the caster to choose which type of monster to summon even undead can be summoned, there is no limit to the number of creatures that can be summoned so a patient mage can easily go about creating a army.

  A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half. This is a more powerful version of the fireball spell, when the final word of the invocation is uttered three roaring balls of flame fly forth to strike 3 respective targets.~

  Duration: 1 Turn

  Casting time: 8
  
  A effective intra-combat spell for the adventuring mage. When cast reality is seen to warp and twist around the caster and he visibly fades out of existence. In actuality the caster is displaced slightly from the normal stream of time. 
  The effect of this temporal displacement is to make the mage harder to affect from normal reality. Weapons seem not to be able to connect with the mage and any none magical weapon is incapable of affecting the mage. Because the mage no longer exists in the normal flow of events while under the effects of this spell no aging can take place, also speed altering spells and spells that imprison or maze  are useless against the mage. From the mages view the world appears to be moving exceedingly slowly but to others the mage moves extremely quickly becoming a deadly foe.
  Effects:
  Immunity to non-magical weapons.
  40% resistance to all forms of physical attack.
  +2 to all saving throws
  +2 Armour class
  Immunity to speed altering, imprisonment and maze spells.  ~

  To cast this spell the mage simply snaps their fingers. A audible in rush of air occurs and the mage vanishes. In actuality the mage has teleported away.

  With this powerful spell the mage calls forth material from the ethereal plane of existence and shapes it into a spear of magical energy. At the culmination of the spell this magical bolt ripples forth from the mages hands and strikes one opponent of his choosing. The bolt is near infinitely sharp and cuts easily through flesh and bone as such when the bolt strikes a target there is a good chance that it will instantly slay the target and if it does not it is still capable of passing right through the targets body doing massive damage. 
  Effects:
  The vorpal bolt deals 6d8 points of piercing damage to the target. There is also a 25% chance that the bolt will instantly slay the target. A save versus death is allowed.~

  When cast the mages blood bubbles and warps turning into a highly concentrated acid. Strangely enough this has no adverse effect on the caster. It does however prove a powerful deterrent to attack. When a successful attack is made the casters blood sprays onto the attacker. The blood now being highly acidic burns and scars the attacker eating into their flesh. While also hurting the attackers the acid in the blood burns away all poisons that might effect the caster. 
  Effects:
  Every attack made against the caster does 2d8+3 acid damage to the attacker.

  This spell is generally accompanied by a wave of evil laughter. Apparently this spell was created by a fairy godmother (who as everyone knows are generally pretty strange people) gone mad. The kitchen maid  had of course just married the prince.  The fairy godmother was casting a spell to allow them to dance in mid air surrounded by music and magical lights. However during the casting, for absolutely no apparent reason the fairy godmother went completely and utterly insane. The spell reflected this sudden change of mental state and the bodies of the maid and prince withered into decayed corpses dancing for all eternity (funnily enough no one really seemed to mind since the marriage was only so the king could fulfill a clause in a will allowing him to collect a vast inheritance). Never the less despite the stressful circumstances the court mage managed to copy down the spell as the fairy godmother screamed it. Luckily he had the foresight to copy it onto a fire proof scroll. This was luckily because several seconds later the fairy godmother turned herself into a small purple atomic pumpkin. Several years later when the castle ruins had ceased to glow mauve, an adventuring mage found the scroll and the spell has propagated from that time forth.  
  This spell causes the targets body to decay into rotting corpse that spasms and jerks as it dances to some obscene infernal music. The target can save versus death at -4 otherwise it will dance forever or until slain. Even if they resist the effect of spell they are still cursed with bad luck for 6 hours.~

  A particular mage who long frequented the Waterdeep region of the realms was a keen fan of magical dueling. In this dangerous sport magical items were bet and two mages would duel till one submitted, the winner taking the items. The mages name was Belfarst, he created a winning strategy where by he would estimate his opponents ability and then count the number of spells they had cast so that he always had spells when his opponent was out. This method of dueling however failed him when he encountered Melectar.
  Melectar had long researched what powers allowed a mage to memorize spells. This enchantment was his result, it allowed him to rememorize spells after he had cast them. Although the casting was very difficult Melectar managed to cast it before the duel. Belfarst was horrified to discover that when he still had only a few magic missile spells left, Melectar was till tossing chain lightning. Melectar won, accidentally killing Belfarst with a disintegrate spell. This spell is his legacy to magic though its uses stretch far beyond dueling.
  This spell rememorizes one wizard spell of 6th level or lower every turn for the duration of spell. Due to the energies involved there is a small chance that the spell will cause 5d10 damage upon casting, the spell regeneration will still occur though.~

Weapons striking the bubbles are slowed and hence can only do minimal damage. Non- Magical weapons are totally unable to penetrate the bubble. Only one bubble may be cast on a creature any more then this and the spell becomes ineffective.

  Tereledra was a powerful archmage who resided on the plane of dust, a plane that sucks the life out of its inhabitants. Tereledra had long traveled the planes and had built up many enemies especially in the anarchist faction of Sigil. After being attacked by a group of anarchist wild mages he decided to give it all up, change his name and vanish. 
  For many years he journeyed the inner planes free of his old foes. He joined with a well respected group of mercenaries and traveled with them long, eventually he confided in them his old and secret identity, feeling he could trust them. Little had he bargained on the size of the anarchists reward for his head. The mercenary group turned on him. They underestimated his power and Tereledra in a fit of rage slew them all consigning their souls to a pocket plane to serve him for all eternity. This spell their only gateway to the rest of the planes. It is believed that Tereledra was later slain when one of the wraith company was resurrected by a sympathetic priest, the freed wraith killed Tereledra in a single stroke.  This spell will call forth 5 to 10 wraiths of Tereledra's old mercenary group. The wraiths will serve the caster for 2 hours before returning to their pocket plane. The wraiths are fighters of between 7th and 10th level carrying +1 equipment. The wraiths will serve the caster without question but cannot communicate with anything else. The wraiths will also serve Tereledra before any other so they are incapable of fighting him or in any way inconveniencing him. ~
