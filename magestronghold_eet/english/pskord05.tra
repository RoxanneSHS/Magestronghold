@0    = ~In the name of all that is just, we have come to stop you, Sorcerer! Your vile magic pollutes our city, temples, and even our world. You represent all that we oppose, and we have judged you unworthy to live. Prepare for your execution!~
@1    = ~You fools! You seek to judge me?! You cannot judge what you cannot comprehend! I am eternal and infinitely powerful, but perhaps more importantly to you, I am now very mad! And you, my dear Messengers of Justice, are in my way! ~
