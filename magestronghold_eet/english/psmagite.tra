@0    = ~We're doing some fascinating experiments involving the creation of magical weapons.~
@1    = ~Could you teach me how to make magical items?~
@2    = ~Very good. Carry on.~
@3    = ~But of course. A powerful Archmage like yourself would have no problem.~
@4    = ~Here; take this textbook. It outlines all the basic principles and spells. From then on its all experimentation and experience.~
@5    = ~Thank you.~
@6    = ~Of course, you'll need a furnace to forge the metal, 
but there are some in this Sphere, aren't there? Also, you'll need the basic components, so if you want to make a magical sword you will need an unenchanted sword to work with. Well, everything seems to be in order. Goodbye.~
