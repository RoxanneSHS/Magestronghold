@0 = ~Greetings my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I am sorry, but with all of the preparations going on, I'm going to have to insist that you leave.~
@1 = ~What exactly are you preparing for?~
@2 = ~Right. Sorry.~
@3 = ~You can't tell me where to go! I'm your Headmaster!~
@4 = ~(sigh) The Professor is conducting another rediculous experiment that is likely to get us all killed. Any other questions?~
@5 = ~Er. Sorry.~
@6 = ~What, do you have a deathwish? Are you insane or just stupid? The Professor is conducting another moronic experiment that will get us all killed. And you want to stay here. You can take my place then.~
@7 = ~Back again? You really are insane aren't you? Why don't you go talk to the Professor and leave those of us sane enough to understand what is about to happen in peace.~
