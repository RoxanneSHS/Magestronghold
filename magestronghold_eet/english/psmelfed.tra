@0    = ~And so we meet again, little Mageling. My, you are industrious. I happen to know for a fact that the Demilich was really quite upset. ~
@1    = ~Well, wouldn't you be after being forced onto another plane of existence?~
@2    = ~Yes, I suppose I would. The Prime especially. I have always thought it a rather grotty little plane. Never liked it much, but nonetheless that will soon no longer be a problem.  ~
@3    = ~I have power to forge... Now, what was it I came here for...? Ah yes; to end your miserable, and from this point on very short and excruciatingly painful, lives.~
@4    = ~Wait...! Whats this? Not more disturbances! Excuse me for just one minute, while I kill yet *another* bunch of fools.~
@7    = ~Well, I must say we appear to be unable to hold a civil conversation without someone trying to kill me. And now those fools have delayed me. I was so looking forward to destroying you, but I must be off. But do not despair! Your destruction is still imminent. I believe these creatures should be more then capable of taking care of you. Farewell, my Adventurer friends!~
