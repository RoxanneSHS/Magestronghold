@0    = ~What is this? Who are you?!~
@1    = ~I am a emissary from the Cowled Wizards whom you have betrayed. Do you know why I have come?~
@2    = ~Ah, so they have sent someone expendable, have they? How typical and resourceful of them.~
@3    = ~I am not expendable! And I am by no means powerless. I am more then a match for any Cowled Wizard!~
@4    = ~Oh, I am sure that you are, but are you as cunning? That is the question.~
@5    = ~Enough of this! Hand over the artifact, or my magic will overwhelm yours!~
@6    = ~You fool! Do you really think I would hand over the most powerful artifact in all of Faerun to you? No, I dont think so. The Red Wizards have promised me wealth and power far beyond what those pathetic Cowled Wizards could ever have provided! Prepare to die!~
@7    = ~Then face my wrath, mage!~
@8    = ~I am sure that I will.~
